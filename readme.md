Deliverables from the Pioneer AppRadio Hackathon

Oct 30 to Nov 2, I participated in a "hackathon" where the deliverable turned out to be just 5 .pdf screenshot slides and a two page summary of the app. The Pioneer engineers could not get their SDK ready in time, and of the 9 people who showed up on day 1, there were only 3 developers in the crowd, counting myself. There were to be a total of 9 cash prizes. Every single person who submitted an entry won, except for Roger Pincombe and myself.  

It's a week away from much more productive work, but I figured, worst case scenario, it'd just be a fun experience, with an awesome Halloween party in Vegas. Unfortunately, the Halloween party turned out to be a complete let-down. The entire "Halloween Bash" consisted of basically a game of bean-bag throws with the advertised electronic prizes replaced with $5 Halloween store trash. Since I tried to galvanize many to come down to Vegas with me, I would have been mortified if my colleagues had made the case to be excused from work to come down to this dump. (I already felt pretty bad that Roger flew down for this.)  

It was a disappointing week that could have been much better. I ended up not having any fun at all in Vegas, focusing on developing the apps. I returned home haggard and tired, but having learned well the lesson that AppRadio is not a platform I should develop for.

Social Radio - 
I was able to get the natural speech engine NeoSpeech Trial ported/wrapped for iOS and basic speech profile analysis for the word cursor identification, done during the hackathon. It's actually pretty decently natural sounding, and you can try a demo on the neospeech.com website. 

ALDL - Automobile Location Data Locker
This was my BS'd 45-minute entry. It's a way to seamlessly check-in to venues and identify landmarks as you drive along known trails. 

AAA - Automobile Accessories Anywhere
I hacked together a basic engine that lets people view how certain types of hardwood and covers would look on a sample 3D truck, that can be viewed at from different angles.
